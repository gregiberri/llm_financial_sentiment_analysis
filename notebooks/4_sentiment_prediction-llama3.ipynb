      "Per the deal, GE will supply approximately 693 megawatts (MW) of wind turbines in 16 different project sites across the country’s Aragon region. The company will install a total of 110 units of 6.1-158 wind turbines in the Zaragoza region in six phases. The first phase, which is already in progress, will see 33 units of wind turbines being constructed at five wind farms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the 110 GE turbines, 33 turbines will have a hub height of 101 meters and the rest will have a hub height of 120.9 meters. The delivery of the turbine units will be completed by 2024 end.\n",

      "This deal supports Spain’s effort to shift toward renewable sources of energy and will attract similar projects in 2024.\n",

      "Recently, General Electric has received a series of deals, which are likely to drive its growth. In November 2023, General Electric secured a deal from O2 Power Private Limited to deliver, install and commission 36 units of workhorse 2.7-132 onshore wind turbines.
